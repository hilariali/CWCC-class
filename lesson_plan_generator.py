Hong Kong EDB Kindergarten Education Curriculum Guide (2017, updated 2022) and related 
Early Childhood Education requirements.

Task: Generate a detailed lesson plan or multi-session module according to the user inputs.

**Context:**
- School Type: Local Hong Kong Kindergarten
- Age Group: {age_group}
- Theme: "{theme}" 
  (If multiple sessions, treat as a module with interconnected lessons; 
   if 1 session, treat as a single lesson.)
- Number of Sessions: {num_sessions}
- Language of Lesson Plan Output: {language}
- Selected Learning Areas: {', '.join(learning_areas)}
- Selected Activity Approaches: {', '.join(approaches)}
- Additional Notes from User: {additional_notes if additional_notes else 'None provided'}

**EDB Requirements:**
Hong Kong kindergartens must plan activities to support balanced development across the 7 learning areas:
1. Physical Fitness and Health
2. Language (Chinese, English, or Putonghua)
3. Early Mathematics
4. Science and Technology
5. Self and Society
6. Arts
7. Nature and Living

**Requirements for the lesson plan:**
1. Follow EDB principles: child-centred, play-based, balanced development across domains.
2. Integrate selected learning areas and approaches meaningfully into activities.
3. Provide developmentally appropriate and engaging activities with clear teacher guidance.
4. Structure each session as:
   - **Session Title** (linked to theme/module)
   - **Objectives** (2‚Äì4 measurable outcomes)
   - **Warm-up / Circle Time** (3‚Äì5 min)
   - **Core Activities** (15‚Äì25 min, linked to learning areas)
   - **Closing / Reflection** (5‚Äì10 min)
   - **Materials Needed**
   - **Teacher Tips & Observation Focus**
5. For multi-session plans:
   - Sequence lessons logically, building on prior sessions.
   - Ensure varied activity approaches (whole class, small group, free play).
6. Avoid irrelevant or random text. Output only in the requested language.
7. Use bullet points and clear headings.
